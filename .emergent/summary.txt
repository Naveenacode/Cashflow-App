<analysis>**original_problem_statement**: The user's request has evolved significantly. The initial project was to build an LA Investment Platform based on a PDF, which was fully implemented but later abandoned.

The current and active project is a **Spend Tracker Application**. The requirements are:
1.  Track expenses and income by date, segregated by month.
2.  A dashboard to visualize income, expense, and profit.
3.  Ability to add custom income and expense categories (headers).
4.  Set budget limits on categories and receive alerts when a limit is reached.
5.  Profit from the last month should be carried over as income to the next month. Any budget deficiency should be carried over as a loan.
6.  The dashboard home should feature pie charts for income and expense breakdowns.
7.  A Compare tab to compare data from two different periods using line graphs (category on X-axis, amount on Y-axis).
8.  A customizable time period selector (monthly, quarterly, half-yearly, yearly, custom) should be integrated into the main header next to the month selector.
9.  Clicking on a category in the pie charts or budget status list should filter the transactions list to show only transactions for that category.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack Spend Tracker application has been built with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend.
-   **Backend**: Manages all business logic, including transactions, categories, budgets, and period-based statistics. It uses in-memory Python dictionaries as a temporary database, so data is not persistent across restarts.
-   **Frontend**: A single-page React application () that handles all UI rendering and state management. It includes custom-built components for pie charts and line graphs. The UI allows users to add transactions, manage categories, view a dashboard with visualizations, and compare different time periods.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working**: Implementing the user's request to move the time period selector (for monthly, quarterly, annual views) from a separate tab into the main header, placing it next to the existing month/year selector for a more integrated experience.
-   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
-   **Agent Testing Done**: N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?**: Frontend testing agent. The agent should be instructed to restart the frontend service first, then verify that the new integrated time period selector in the header is visible and functional. It should test selecting Quarterly and Annually to ensure the dashboard data and title update correctly.
-   **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
There are no outstanding bugs. The current focus is on completing an in-progress feature request.

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1: Finalize and Test the Integrated Time Period Selector** (P0 - HIGHEST)
    -   **Where to resume**: The agent has already modified the  file to move the UI and update the logic. The next step is to update the dashboard's main title to reflect the selected period (e.g., Dashboard for Q4 2025). After that, the agent must restart the frontend service (frontend: ERROR (not running)
frontend: started) and test the feature's functionality.
    -   **What will be achieved with this?**: A more streamlined and user-friendly UI for selecting time periods, as requested by the user.
    -   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend
    -   **Blocked on something**: No.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
There are no new tasks requested by the user beyond the current one.

**Completed work in this session**
-   **Spend Tracker Feature: Core Functionality**: Implemented adding and viewing of income/expense transactions and categories.
-   **Spend Tracker Feature: Budget Limits**: Added functionality to set budget limits on expense categories and display alerts on the frontend when the budget is exceeded.
-   **Spend Tracker Feature: Carryover Logic**: Implemented backend logic to carry over the previous month's profit/loss as the current month's opening balance.
-   **Spend Tracker Feature: Interactive Visualizations**:
    -   Created a dashboard with Pie Charts for income/expense breakdown ().
    -   Created a Compare view with Line Graphs for period-over-period analysis ().
    -   Made chart sections and budget lists clickable to filter the main transaction list.
-   **LA Investment Platform (ABANDONED)**: A full-stack investment platform was built and then discarded due to a change in user requirements.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   **Issue 1**: Admin login was not working on the initial LA Investment Platform application. This is no longer relevant as the entire project was pivoted to the Spend Tracker.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend**: React, TailwindCSS. State is managed locally within the  component using  and  hooks.
-   **Backend**: FastAPI.
-   **Database**: The application currently uses in-memory Python dictionaries in  to mock database functionality. Data is not persistent.
-   **Architecture**: A simple full-stack architecture with a React frontend making API calls to a FastAPI backend.

**key DB schema**
The application does not use a persistent database. The data is held in-memory in  using the following structures:
-   : A list of dictionaries.
-   : A list of dictionaries.
-   : A dictionary mapping month-year strings to carryover data.

**changes in tech stack**
-   The project pivoted from an investment platform that used MongoDB to a spend tracker.
-   The spend tracker currently uses a non-persistent, in-memory data store instead of MongoDB.

**All files**
-   : Core backend logic for the Spend Tracker. Manages all API endpoints and in-memory data.
-   : Defines the Pydantic data models for the Spend Tracker.
-   : The central frontend file containing all UI, state management, and rendering logic for the Spend Tracker. It was heavily modified for each new feature.
-   : Handles all API communication between the frontend and backend.
-   : A reusable component for displaying pie charts.
-   : A reusable component for displaying line graphs in the compare view.

**Areas that need refactoring**
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**: This file has become a monolith, containing almost all of the frontend's state and logic. It should be broken down into smaller, self-contained components and custom hooks to improve maintainability.
-   **Data Persistence**: The backend's in-memory data storage should be replaced with a persistent database (e.g., MongoDB, which is available in the environment) to prevent data loss on server restart.

**key api endpoints**
-   : Retrieves all data for the main dashboard, including totals, breakdowns, and carryover figures, based on a specified time period.
-   : Creates a new income or expense transaction.
-   : Creates a new transaction category.
-   : Retrieves aggregated stats for a specific time period, used in the Compare view.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   The entire LA Investment Platform project is obsolete. Focus only on the Spend Tracker.
-   The database is currently mocked in memory and is not persistent. Be aware that any data created for testing will be lost if the backend restarts.
-   The most urgent task is to complete the integration of the time period selector into the header of . The agent was mid-task; you need to apply the final UI change (updating the title), then restart the frontend and test the feature thoroughly.

2.  **Request**: Make pie charts the home page, enable comparison selection, and make categories in charts clickable to filter transactions. **Status**: COMPLETED.
3.  **Request**: Use a line graph for the compare section. **Status**: COMPLETED.
4.  **Request**: Embed the time period selector next to the month tab in the header. **Status**: IN PROGRESS.
5.  There are no other pending user messages.

**Project Health Check:**
-   **Broken**: The frontend is potentially in a non-functional state as  was heavily edited without restarting or testing the service.
-   **Mocked**: The entire backend database is mocked with in-memory Python dictionaries in .

**Testing status**
-   **Testing agent used after significant changes**: NO
-   **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop**: NO
-   **Test files created**: None.
-   **Known regressions**: None.

**Credentials to test flow:**
-   No authentication is required for the application.

**What agent forgot to execute**
-   The agent did not restart the frontend service (frontend: stopped
frontend: started) after making multiple, significant edits to  to implement the integrated time period selector. This is a critical next step to check if the recent changes introduced any errors.</analysis>
